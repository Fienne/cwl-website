## Software Freedom Conservancy

![Software Freedom Conservancy](/assets/img/conservancy-header.svg()

CWL is a member project of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/), a non-profit organization that provides a legal home for free and open source software (FOSS) projects. 

The day-to-day governance of CWL is largely self-managed by the [CWL community](/community/) with oversight from the CWL leadership team (below), while the Conservancy is our host organization for any legal, licensing and financial issues.
