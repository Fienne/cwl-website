# Specification

The Common Workflow Language (CWL) project produces free and open standards for describing command-line tool based workflows. These standards are [implemented](/implementations/) in many popular workflow systems. 

For developers and advanced users, the current [CWL Standards v1.2.0](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/) provides authoritative documentation of the execution of CWL documents. The previous versions, [CWL Standards v1.0.2](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/) and [CWL Standards v1.1.0](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.1/), are also available.
