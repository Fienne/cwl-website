    <p>Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an open standard for describing command line tools and how to connect them  to create workflows.</p>
    
    <p>Because CWL is a specification and not a specific piece of software, tools and workflows described using CWL are portable across a variety of platforms that support the CWL standard. CWL is well suited for describing large-scale workflows in cluster, cloud and high performance computing environments where tasks are scheduled in parallel across many nodes.</p>
