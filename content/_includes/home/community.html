CWL is developed by a multi-vendor working group consisting of organizations and individuals aiming to enable scientists to share data analysis workflows. The CWL project is maintained on Github and we follow the Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development. Legally CWL is a member project of Software Freedom Conservancy and is formally managed by the elected CWL leadership team, however every-day project decisions are made by the CWL community which is open for participation by anyone.

If youâ€™re interested in joining the CWL community, we recommend checking out the following resources and forums:

<ul>
<li> The place to ask a question about all things CWL is on [the CWL Discourse Group](https://cwl.discourse.group/). Previously we used [biostars.org](https://www.biostars.org/t/cwl/) where you can still read older responses. </li> 

If you are interested in learning more or contributing ideas or code, [come chat with us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language), check out [#CommonWL on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CommonWL), join the [mailing list common-workflow-language on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/common-workflow-language) or [fork the repository](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language) and send a pull request!

Besides the web interface for the mailing list, one can also join by sending a blank email to common-workflow-language+subscribe@googlegroups.com and replying to the automated response.

The CWL Project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
