If youâ€™re interested in joining the CWL community, we recommend checking out the following resources and forums:

    The place to ask a question about all things CWL is on the CWL Discourse Group. Previously we used biostars.org where you can still read older responses.

    If you are interested in learning more or contributing ideas or code, come chat with us on Gitter, check out #CommonWL on Twitter, join the mailing list common-workflow-language on Google Groups or fork the repository and send a pull request!

    Besides the web interface for the mailing list, one can also join by sending a blank email to common-workflow-language+subscribe@googlegroups.com and replying to the automated response.
