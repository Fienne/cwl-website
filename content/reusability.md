## Reusability and Reproduciblity with CWL
CWL workflows are portable, reusable, and flexible.  Reproduction, re-use, and replication of computational methods requires a complete description of what computer applications were used, how exactly they were used, and how they were connected to each other. To this end, CWL enables portability by being explicit about data locations and execution models. For increased flexiblity, individual CWL tool definitions can be reused in any new workflow.
