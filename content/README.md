# CWL Website 2.0

The in-progress redesign of the CWL Website

## To-Do

* Add Home logo on left side of nav
* Remove unnecessary img files from assets/img/ once final icons are decided on
* Check `a { word-break: keep-all }` in Firefox and Safari, to confirm it's behaving properly

## Reference

```scss
$grid-breakpoints: (
  xs: 0,
  xxs: 425px,
  sm: 576px,
  md: 768px,
  lg: 992px,
  xl: 1200px,
